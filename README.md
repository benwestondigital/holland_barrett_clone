## Description

This Holland & Barret clone site was built to display my Cypress testing and Front-end development skills.

- Three pages - products, individual product page, basket

- Small selection of products taken from the website

- Set up testing attributes for Cypress with [data-testid=*] tags

- With the small scope of the project, I wanted the main feature to be adding items to the basket
- Most other features/links are cosmetic
- No backend - data does not persist with page refresh



## To Run

- Download into local folder

- Install dependencies with `npm install`

- Start project with `npm run dev`

- Open cypress with `npx cypress open`

- Run tests in cypress using the GUI
